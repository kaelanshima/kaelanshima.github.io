*E3: Preparing for WODs Technical Essay*

  Invoice1 WOD was the most recent scheduled WOD that I have worked on, the WOD instructions were to create a sales receipt using expressions and variables to compute the various needed values dynamically. 

WOD Link: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html 

Some experiences I had while performing the WOD was getting to remember how to use certain code/statements like getting to use var statements. Figuring out how to get the code to work was a challenge, I was missing a few things like ; or using " instead of ' to make sure the code would work. Some things I did to prepare for this WOD was looking back on the notes I have taken within the class and notes I took on expressions and variables to make sure I used the right code. Making sure I can understand the content with the least amount of flaws possible. I did something similar to this with the other WODs. What also really helped was just reviewing the previous lesson before I started doing the WOD as a nice refresher to the stuff I couldn’t remember in the moment when I needed it. Something that I could have done to prepare better for this WOD, was to make sure I had everything fully installed while doing this WOD, I switched from my usual Mac laptop to my Home Windows laptop so I can use two monitors for this assignment. I ended up not missing some parts I had to look for within my mac that I then had to add onto the windows version of my code. Also another thing I want to start doing to prepare for these WODs is to start looking back on old tests and quizzes as well as previous WODs and Labs to get a better grasp on the content. Something I want to try differently with the next WOD is to have the slides just kept open in the back to have an extra assist while doing the WODs when I’m missing something that I can’t remember at the moment, and to have less delay on what I’m trying to remember.
