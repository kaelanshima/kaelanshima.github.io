  <p><em>E4: Progress in Programming Report</em></p>

<p><strong>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</strong>
  My programming skills have miraculously changed throughout the semester, especially near the beginning I felt like I was doing okay, not really able to think syntactically. I felt like I was also struggling a lot more in the beginning, over time the work caught up to me and I felt like I was really struggling until I took the time to self-learn certain parts of the code. Using W3 as a way to wedge through the struggles I was facing and not understanding throughout the course, I wouldn’t say I’m in an algorithmic mindset yet, but I feel like I can get there and maybe more by the end of the semester. From the beginning of the semester to now, has had a large gap between what I knew then to what I knew now, I feel like I learned a lot through this class and my programming skills have greatly improved.</p>

<p><strong>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</strong>
  To promote my programming skills, I need to put more time into coding. I usually have good time management but with the shift from online to in-person and starting a new job. It took me a bit to get a grasp on what I was doing before I could really get into it. Now that we are heading towards the end of the semester I feel that my time management has definitely improved and has been fined tuned my work with this class and my 5 other classes alongside this one.</p>

<p><strong>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</strong>
  Those beginning WODS I could definitely do without copying the screencast, like all the SmartPhoneProduct WODS. When it comes to the invoice I still feel that I struggle, but with understanding what I need to do and setting it on a mindmap or really just writing better notes within my code, to remember what I’m doing. It really helps with how I go about doing the labs and assignments, I could possibly do the WODS without the screencast but I would not be able within the timeframe that is given.</p>

<p><strong>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</strong>
  With the labs when we get to do the task ourselves, I can definitely work through the labs when they are well-worded, I feel that the more descriptive they the easier it is to understand the purpose of the questions. When we do the labs in class I understand what we are learning, and follow along with the readings, understanding how the concepts go hand-in-hand with the experience.</p>

<p><strong>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</strong>
  There is still a lot I feel I need to work on before feeling ready to work on Assignment 2, but I am ready to work through the assignment and learn how the concepts from the class go with the assignment and I hope I can use my experience and be able to finish Assignment 2 faster than Assignment 1.</p>

<p><strong>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</strong>
  I feel that the videos and going over the labs truly do help my way of learning. This is my first semester in person and it was a struggle to switch between online to in-person courses. I felt that being able to have the screencasts and getting to redo the WODS over and over until I can grasp what was supposed to be done. It helped to have the videos and when there was no more screencast it took a while to understand how I should be doing certain parts, but using W3 schools helped with understanding the certain code that I felt I struggled with.</p>

<p><strong>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</strong>
  As I said previously, what helped me most throughout the class was doing the WODS and the screencasts, the quizzes I felt were reminders of what I was understanding through the readings, like a mastery of understanding through those readings. Overall working through the WODS and the screencast was my biggest help, I know joining the office hours also helped, especially to work through assignment 1.</p>
