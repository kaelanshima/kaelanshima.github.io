  <p><em>UI Basics Technical Essay</em></p>

<p>Everyone of my WOD’s I have DNF’d, I attempt to practice them as often as I can. My first WOD was my most successful, having my lowest time being 22:38. I haven’t watched any of the screencaps, but I feel that I am close to understanding and remembering code. I don’t want to watch the videos until I have either come very close or finished the WODS. Rereading each step and reviewing each part of the WOD has helped. I feel like I have reread each part of the WODS and always am missing one or two things. I just need to learn to read a lot more carefully.</p>

<p>A really good reminder is me going to the WODS daily, and just reading them. Sometimes I see something one day that I didn’t the other. Always come back to the WODS and just try to pull them apart to understand each section and part of them that I am missing. I know based on my abilities that I can finish the WODS without the video, but I need to extend my time studying what I’m missing or what error I am putting into my code. It is always just one symbol off. My best advice would be to use a bigger monitor or make somehow make the program a lot bigger. Even just reading each line, seeing what comma or colon/semicolon you are missing. Those are usually the parts that trick me the most. I will continue my quest to successfully finish the WODS without the screencap, but in the meantime, I will be re-doing the WODS until I am successful, and have a more reasonable time.</p>
